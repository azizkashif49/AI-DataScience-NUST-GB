Using Computer Vision techniques to create an Expression Classification system using deep ConvNet, Tensorflow, Keras. Using Convolutional Neural Network Architecture.

Learning discriminative features for expressions from facial images captured in the wild is a non-trivial task due to intra-class variations and inter-class similarities. Furthermore, background clutter, illumination changes, large pose variations, and partial or full occlusions make it more challenging. The goal of this project is to design and develop a computer vision system that can classify facial expressions. Such a system can have several real-world applications. For example, expressions can be useful for Human-Computer Interaction based recommendation systems to determine whether to push product information or not. It can also be used to determine the psychological state of a person during online interviews. Overall, this project will provide students with a practical opportunity to implement the concepts learnt during the module. It will also allow them to understand practical problems where computer vision can provide solutions. Students will engage in the identification of tools and techniques that can be employed to solve those problems.
